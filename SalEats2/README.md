# Sal Eats 2
ABSTRACT
Sal Eats 2 is a website to find local restaurants and book a reservation!

FEATURES
1. The google maps API to help users identify where they are located to help search for local restuarants.
2. A yelp API is used to search for restaurants and based on the users inputs.
3. Google Calendar allows users to book a reservation in their personal calendar to rember the date!
4. A database is used to store all accounts created and remember their favorited restaurants for a quick and easy search.

HOW TO RUN
You want to first download both zip files.
Then Start by running the SalEats.sql in mySql Workbench
Next go to eclipse and run the Assignment4 using tomcat for the home-page.jsp.

Once they are both running you can drag the url to a browser and go through the website as normal.

Things to Note! 
	1. In the eclipse project I assume that when connecting to mysql the user = "root"
		and password = "root". Change accordingly.

	2. The SalEats.sql creates a database called SalEats. So if there is an existing SalEats. 
		please make sure to delete it before running the program. 

	3. The Screen Resolution for my laptop is 1440x900, so there may be some differences when viewing on screens of different sizes.
